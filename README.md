# Testkube-Samples--Janemils
The repository for all the k6, postman collection, testkube trials.

It contains a sample K6 script that runs a simple GET call and prints the response in the console. This should always give you a pass response [200 OK] provided that the service is running absolutely fine.

It also contains a sample Postman script, that runs a few GET and POST calls. It's deliberately written to give you some failure responses to observe the failed cases in Testkube. On executing this, you will observe a mixture of pass and failed scenarios.

Anyhoo, feel free to use the sample code for your testkube explorations!
